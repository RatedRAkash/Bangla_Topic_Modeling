# Bangla_Topic_Modeling

##Abstract##
Due to the revolutionary changes in information technology, the amount of digitized text data generated is massive. Manually extracting useful information from this broad collection of documents is tiresome. Topic modeling is a statistical method to infer the hidden semantics of documents or text corpus by a probabilistic approach. As it reduces the time and effort of an individual, it has become a promising domain in NLP. A significant amount of research has been carried out in this field over the years. However, there are only a few handfuls of research in the Bangla language. In our research, we have introduced a new model in the Bangla language called ProdLDA. We have collected around 288k Bangla newspaper documents from various popular Bangla newspaper sites. Based on this dataset, we have analyzed and made a detailed comparison of ProdLDA with other baseline models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA). At last, after evaluating the performance of these models on various evaluation matrices, we have chosen the best model (ProdLDA). Then, using ProdLDA, we have extracted topics from the dataset to get a clear overview of the recent trending news in the Bangla language.
